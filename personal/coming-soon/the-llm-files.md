## Blog: The LLM Files

![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coming%20Soon-brightgreen)

I've spent a lot of time over the past year learning about large language models (LLMs).

I'm (still) fascinated by their potential and all the use-cases that can be unlocked with a bit of creative thinking. 

I recently set up an archive of outputs [here](https://danielgoesprompting.com/).

A much more selective project on my 'to do' list is creating a blog in which I share some notes about what's worked (and maybe what hasn't) in my own experiments with AI. 

This project is in the works!
